            <p>
              Klondike Solitaire is played with a standard 52-card deck. The objective is to build four foundation piles, one for each suit, starting with the Ace and building up to the King.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4">Setup</h3>
            <p>
              The game begins with seven tableau piles. The first pile has one card, the second has two cards, and so on, with each pile having one more card than the previous. The top card of each pile is face-up, while all other cards are face-down. The remaining cards form the stock pile.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4">Basic Moves</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Cards in the tableau can be moved if they create a descending sequence with alternating colors (red and black).</li>
              <li>Only Kings can be placed on empty tableau spots.</li>
              <li>Cards can be moved from the tableau to the foundation piles in ascending order (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) by suit.</li>
              <li>You can draw cards from the stock pile when you have no moves available.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4">Stock and Waste Piles</h3>
            <p>
              When you click on the stock pile, either one or three cards (depending on the variation) are drawn and placed in the waste pile. The top card of the waste pile is available for play. When the stock pile is empty, the waste pile can be reused as the stock pile, usually for a limited number of times.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4">Foundation Piles</h3>
            <p>
              The four foundation piles are built up by suit from Ace to King. All cards must be moved to the foundation piles to win the game. Cards in the foundation piles are no longer in play.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4">Winning the Game</h3>
            <p>
              The game is won when all 52 cards have been moved to the foundation piles. If no more moves are possible and cards remain outside the foundation piles, the game is lost.
